# ArchrVSZombi-CSharpPort
This is a rewrite of my previous semester's Python assignment, in C#!
## How different is it from the previous one?
These two differs in terms of
1. This is even more buggier than the last one, since I did a whole rewrite in C# including classes and subclasses like Entity and Field, it is way more sloppy and buggy. Still has some kinks to work out.
2. As I said before, I rewrote it from the source code of Python. It is fully C#
## Why do you want to do a full codebase rewrite, isn't it already good enough in Python?
Well, I wanted a challenge and I got it. It was a whole heck of a time rewriting functions into class methods and variable types into another, et cetera. I gotta say, I still don't hate programming yet.
## Any more porting?
Yes, I intend to try and port this to pure C, both compilable by GCC and other compilers.
## Can I contribute?
Yes, please oh my. If you want to help me, shoot me and email or my contact methods. I will be sure to get in contact.
